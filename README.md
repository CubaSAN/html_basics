# HTML BASICS

 - Clone repository
 - Make copy from index html file somewhere in folder
 - Make changes in index html file to create page similar as in task folder
 - Create pages login, signup, experiments html using previously copied index file as example
 - Add All missed parts to newly created pages
 - On experiments page place all tags you now as much as possible
 - Validate all pages via html validator, all page should be valid except of experiments page, can be invalid.
